# 🌟 Estimate Multimodal Transformer Observation Difference

🚀 **Multimodal Transformer Model** | **Image Observation Comparison**

### 🔥 Project Overview

Welcome to the **Estimate Multimodal Transformer Observation Difference** project! This project focuses on utilizing a multimodal transformer to generate **observations from two images** and **calculate a numerical difference** between the observations. The images are from the **BDD100K dataset**, and we use **Fuyu-8B model** to compare the observations and generate high-level metrics.

---

### 🎯 **Objective**

Our goal is to:
- Analyze **two images** using the multimodal transformer.
- Generate **numerical difference scores** based on observation disagreements.
- Optionally compute **semantic distance** for more advanced comparisons.
